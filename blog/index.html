<div class="article"><h2><a href="2">Thread cancellation and resource leaks</a></h2>

<div class="pub">21 Sep 2012 02:00 GMT</div>
<p>In a multi-threaded C program where threads share address space and
may be operating on shared objects as long as they use the proper
synchronization tools, it's unsafe to asynchronously kill an
individual thread without killing the whole process. Stale locks may
be left behind and data being modified under those locks may be in an
inconsistent state. This includes even internal heap management
structures used by <code>malloc</code>.</p>

<p>As such, the POSIX threads standard does not even offer a mechanism
for forcible termination of individual threads. Instead, it offers
<em>thread cancellation</em>, a mechanism by which early termination of a
thread whose work is no longer needed can be negotiated in such a way
that the thread to be cancelled cleans up any shared state and/or
private resources it may be using before it terminates.</p>

<p>The way cancellation works, from an application standpoint, is that
when thread A no longer needs the work that thread B is performing,
thread A calls <code>pthread_cancel</code> on thread B. Under normal
circumstances, this does not immediately kill thread B - remember,
asynchronously killing threads is fundamentally unsafe. Instead, it
causes as <em>cancellation request</em> to be pending for thread B. The next
time thread B calls a function which is specified by POSIX as a
<em>cancellation point</em>, this request is acted upon, and the thread
terminates (after possibly running cancellation cleanup handlers,
which are analogous to exception handlers in languages with
exceptions). Alternatively, if thread B happened to be blocked at a
cancellation point already when thread A made the cancellation
request, thread B would be immediately cancelled.</p>

<p>This latter case is what makes cancellation a more powerful tool than
simply setting an exit flag for the target thread to inspect:
cancellation can interrupt functions that block waiting for an event
such as input. This is important because, under many circumstances
such as non-responsive network peers or fifos where the other end is
not open, the event for which the thread is blocked waiting may never
happen.</p>

<p>On first consideration, one might consider cancellation unnecessary. A
cancellation-like mechanism seems possible with interrupting signals,
as in:</p>

<pre><code>do {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;ctx-&gt;exitflag_lock);
    int flag = ctx-&gt;exitflag;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;ctx-&gt;exitflag_lock);
    if (flag) pthread_exit(0);
} while ((n = read(fd, buf, sizeof buf)) == -1 &amp;&amp; errno == EINTR);
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this code has a race condition; if a signal is sent to
the thread after <code>ctx-&gt;exitflag</code> is checked, but before <code>read</code> is
called, <code>read</code> will then block indefinitely. This issue can be worked
around by bombarding the thread with such signals until it exits
(possibly with exponential backoff), as in:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned ns = 255;
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;ctx-&gt;exitflag_lock);
ctx-&gt;exitflag = 1;
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;ctx-&gt;exitflag_lock);
while (pthread_kill(ctx-&gt;thread_desc, sig) != ESRCH)
    nanosleep({.tv_nsec=(ns+=ns+1)},0);
</code></pre>

<p>However this solution is not only inelegant but also quite costly, and
the cost grows severely under load when scheduling delays prevent the
target thread from waking up right away.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, thread cancellation would be the definitive
solution to this problem, but low-quality implementations and possibly
even a defect in the standard make it difficult to use cancellation
robustly. Most of the bad implementations are just obviously bad, like
the one in Darwin (MacOSX/iOS) where the developers literally just
invented their own semantics based on the names of the
cancellation-related functions without even looking at what they're
specified to do. Those are topics for another post. What I'd like
to examine now is a much more subtle problem in the NPTL
implementation of POSIX threads used by the GNU C Library (glibc),
which depending on how one interprets the standard, may be a
conformance bug or may just be a flaw in the standard that allows for
very-low-quality implementations that are impossible to use safely.</p>

<p>POSIX specifies the general semantics of thread cancellation in
Chapter 2 (XSH) 2.9.5 Thread Cancellation, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The side-effects of acting upon a cancellation request while
suspended during a call of a function are the same as the
side-effects that may be seen in a single-threaded program when a
call to a function is interrupted by a signal and the given function
returns [EINTR]. Any such side-effects occur before any cancellation
cleanup handlers are called.</p>

<p>Whenever a thread has cancelability enabled and a cancellation
request has been made with that thread as the target, and the thread
then calls any function that is a cancellation point (such as
pthread_testcancel() or read()), the cancellation request shall be
acted upon before the function returns. If a thread has
cancelability enabled and a cancellation request is made with the
thread as a target while the thread is suspended at a cancellation
point, the thread shall be awakened and the cancellation request
shall be acted upon. It is unspecified whether the cancellation
request is acted upon or whether the cancellation request remains
pending and the thread resumes normal execution if:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The thread is suspended at a cancellation point and the event for
which it is waiting occurs</p></li>
<li><p>A specified timeout expired</p></li>
</ul>

<p>before the cancellation request is acted upon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The interesting part is side effects. POSIX specifies quite a few
functions as cancellation points, and their most interesting side
effects are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Allocating file descriptors (<code>accept</code>, <code>open</code>, ...)</li>
<li>Obtaining a lock (<code>fcntl</code>, <code>lockf</code>, <code>sem_wait</code>, ...)</li>
<li>Deallocating file descriptors (<code>close</code>)</li>
<li>Ending the lifetime of a thread ID (<code>pthread_join</code>)</li>
<li>Consuming signals (<code>sigwaitinfo</code>, ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>File IO is of course also a major side effect, but possibly the
least-interesting one in the sense that if you're cancelling a thread
doing IO, you probably don't care about the final state of the open
file except that it get closed and possibly deleted in the cleanup
routines. The others are a lot more critical to safe and correct
program operation.</p>

<p>With regards to the interaction of cancellation and side effects, what
you would like, as the application programmer, is that <em>either</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>the side effects of the function occur, and control returns to the
calling function, <em>or</em></li>
<li>no side effects of the function occur, and control never returns to
the caller, instead passing into cancellation cleanup handlers and
thread termination.</li>
</ol>

<p>The other possibility to be concerned with, however, is that the side
effects of the function occur, but control never returns. Consider
what this would mean for <code>open</code> or <code>accept</code>: a new file descriptor is
allocated, but the descriptor is never returned to the application.
Thus it becomes impossible to close it. The application is left with a
<strong>resource leak</strong>.</p>

<p>A much worse case is <code>close</code>. If the side effects of <code>close</code> take
place without control returning, the application has no way of knowing
the file descriptor was deallocated. If it assumes it's still valid
and attempts to close it again in cleanup handlers or elsewhere in the
program, it may in fact close as <em>different file</em> that was opened
later by another thread and assigned the same file descriptor number.
If it assumes the file descriptor was closed already and this
assumption turns out to be wrong, it leaks a file descriptor.</p>

<p>Are these just theoretical possibilities? Unfortunately, no. The way
NPTL (used by glibc and uClibc) implements cancellable system calls is
essentially (in pseudo-code):</p>

<pre><code>ENABLE_ASYNC_CANCEL();
ret = DO_SYSCALL(...);
RESTORE_OLD_ASYNC_CANCEL();
return ret;
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, it temporarily turns on <em>asynchronous cancellation</em>,
whereby any cancellation request will take place immediately, for the
duration of the system call. This unfortunately leaves a race
condition window after the side effects have taken place (in
kernelspace) but before asynchronous cancellation is turned off,
during which a cancellation request can arrive and be acted upon.</p>

<p>Here is a simple test case which demonstrates the issue:</p>

<pre><code>#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void *writeopener(void *arg)
{
    int fd;
    for (;;) {
        fd = open(arg, O_WRONLY);
        close(fd);
    }
}

void *leaker(void *arg)
{
    int fd = open(arg, O_RDONLY);
    pthread_setcancelstate(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE, 0);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}


#define ITER_COUNT 10000

int main()
{
    pthread_t td, bg;
    struct stat st;
    char tmp[] = "/tmp/cancel_race_XXXXXX";
    int i, leaks=0;

    mkstemp(tmp);
    unlink(tmp);
    mkfifo(tmp, 0600);
    srand(1);
    pthread_create(&amp;bg, 0, writeopener, tmp);
    for (i=0; i&lt;ITER_COUNT; i++) {
        pthread_create(&amp;td, 0, leaker, tmp);
        nanosleep((&amp;(struct timespec){ .tv_nsec=rand()%100000 }), 0);
        pthread_cancel(td);
        pthread_join(td, 0);
    }
    unlink(tmp);
    for (i=4; i&lt;1024; i++) {
        if (!fstat(i, &amp;st)) leaks++, printf("leaked fd %d\n", i);
    }
    return !!leaks;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, is this a conformance issue, or just a show-stoppingly-bad quality
of implementation issue? Let's look again at the language in POSIX.
The only text that explicitly gives an implementation freedom with
regard to the behavior of cancellation is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is unspecified whether the cancellation request is acted upon or
whether the cancellation request remains pending and the thread
resumes normal execution if:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The thread is suspended at a cancellation point and the event for
which it is waiting occurs</p></li>
<li><p>A specified timeout expired</p></li>
</ul>

<p>before the cancellation request is acted upon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way I read this, an implementation is definitely allowed to act on
a cancellation request that arrives after the event for which it's
waiting occurs. Such events might be the availability of input on a
pipe or socket, the arrival of a signal that would satisfy
<code>sigwaitinfo</code>, the availability of free space in a pipe or network
buffer that would make writing possible, etc. I don't however see
anywhere POSIX allows action on a cancellation request that has
arrived not only after the event for which the thread is waiting, but
also after the side effects of the function (such as IO, consuming a
signal, allocating or deallocating a file descriptor, etc.). The
relevant text seems to be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The side-effects of acting upon a cancellation request while
suspended during a call of a function are the same as the
side-effects that may be seen in a single-threaded program when a
call to a function is interrupted by a signal and the given function
returns [EINTR]. Any such side-effects occur before any cancellation
cleanup handlers are called.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My reading of this is that, since a call to <code>open</code> that fails with
<code>EINTR</code> does not allocate a file descriptor, a cancelled call to
<code>open</code> must not do so either. However, the issue remains unresolved
for <code>close</code> (which happens also to be the most dangerous issue) since
POSIX gives implementations the freedom to choose whether to
deallocate the file descriptor on <code>EINTR</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If close() is interrupted by a signal that is to be caught, it shall
return -1 with errno set to [EINTR] and the state of fildes is
unspecified.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even worse, the <code>correct' behavior for</code>close<code>under</code>EINTR<code>(or any
error) is to always deallocate the file descriptor. This is what Linux
does anyway, and the reasons why it's the preferred behavior are way
beyond the scope of this post. However, the</code>correct' behavior for
<code>close</code> under cancellation is obviously to have no side effects, since
an application has no way to distinguish between cases where
a pending cancellation request was acted upon before attempting to
close the file (thus having no side effects) and cases where the
cancellation request arrived during close.</p>

<p>As such, it seems the only safe way to use <code>close</code> with cancellation
is by wrapping it in calls to <code>pthread_setcancelstate</code> that disable
cancellation for the duration of the <code>close</code> call. This is probably
harmless since <code>close</code> cannot in fact block except on special devices
that hook the close event. Even POSIX makes it clear that the
possibility of interruptable blocking in <code>close</code> should be avoided by
implementations, stating in the Rationale (non-normative) section for
the <code>close</code> function:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of interruptible device close routines should be discouraged
to avoid problems with the implicit closes of file descriptors by
exec and exit(). This volume of POSIX.1-2008 only intends to permit
such behavior by specifying the [EINTR] error condition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ideal remedies I would like to see for this issue are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For glibc/NPTL to fix this issue, regardless of whether it's a bug
or just a quality-of-implementation issue. Various non-invasive fixes
are possible, but they all amount to having the cancellation-request
handling code examine the program counter register for the point at
which the thread was interrupted to see if the system call has
completed yet at the point the request was received. In <a href="http://www.musl-libc.org">musl
libc</a>, we do that by having labels in the
assembly language and comparing the saved PC against them, but a
DWARF2-annotation-based approach could also be devised which might be
more appealing to glibc developers.</p></li>
<li><p>For POSIX to clarify that cancellation must not be acted upon when
any side effects of the function have already taken place. This will
allow application programmers targetting conforming systems to
actually use the cancellation interfaces for the purposes they were
intended for.</p></li>
<li><p>For POSIX to remove <code>close</code> from the list of cancellation points.
I've never seen a situation where its being a cancellation point is
beneficial, and the ambiguity of its behavior under <code>EINTR</code>, combined
with the way cancellation side effects are specified in terms of
<code>EINTR</code> behavior, just makes it unnecessarily ugly and difficult to
use.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far, I've filed <a href="http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12683">bug #12683</a> with
glibc, but have not yet pursued anything with the Austin Group for
clarifying the requirements of the standard.</p>

<div class="article"><h2><a href="1">Introducing EWONTFIX</a></h2>

<div class="pub">22 Sep 2012 22:47 GMT</div>
<p>Welcome to EWONTFIX, a blog about, well, bugs. Especially longstanding
unfixed ones in C code for Linux or Unix-like systems. The idea for
this blog grew out of conversations during the development of <a href="http://www.musl-libc.org">musl
libc</a>. Aside from the fact that longstanding
bugs in glibc were one of the original motivations for musl, it turns
out that developing a libc leads to spending a lot of time building
and testing applications. And in the process of testing, one ends up
reading a lot of source. And a lot of source is appallingly bad.</p>

<p>Most low-quality source code just isn't that interesting to write
about. It's more just a matter of identifying the problems, submitting
them to bug trackers, and following up until somebody fixes things.
However there are also a good deal of cases where buggy code <em>is</em>
interesting to discuss. These fall mostly under two major categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The defect is endemic, in the sense that it's become a
widely-copied idiom for other software written in the same language.</p></li>
<li><p>The defect is in widely-used library code and has serious
implications for any application using that code; however, most users
of the library are at best vaguely aware that the defect even exists.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to providing analysis of bugs and design flaws, I aim to
make the posts on EWONTFIX informative with regard to the broader
context in which the flaw appears, covering topics such as thread
cancellation, commit charge and overcommit, and async-signal-safety.</p>

<p>This blog is presently utilizing <a href="http://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a> for
the comment system. Disqus is a third-party service that handles all
the dynamic content off-site so I don't have to worry about server
load, denial of service, and privilege escalation issues on the actual
server EWONTFIX runs on. Anonymous comments are permitted. I'm still
looking for a way to offer (at least read-only) access to the comments
to visitors without JS/AJAX style web browsers. I'm sure some of this
blog's target audience is unhappy with the current comment situation,
but on the bright side, at least you guys can't post to flame about
it.</p>

<p>Attempts at humor aside, I would love a ready-made solution to pull
static comments from Disqus in a form that's ready for pasting into
the page's <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> block, or even better, a gateway to submit
comments from a pure-HTML client. Readers, if you have any leads on
this or want to contribute scripts for it, please post in the comments
(after finding access to a browser that's capable of posting).</p>

<p>Apart from using Disqus for comments, EWONTFIX is running entirely on
static content built using GNU make and simple, portable shell
scripts. All content source is written in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>. The site is styled
with clean, simple CSS. At some point I may take a detour into
meta-blogging to discus the design and implementation of the site
itself - including, of course, bugs found in the process.</p>
