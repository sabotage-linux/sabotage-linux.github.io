## A blog about bugs
###

Welcome to EWONTFIX, a blog dedicated to in-depth coverage of
longstanding defects in software, especially Free and Open Source. The
name EWONTFIX traditionally pokes fun at developers who refuse to fix
or deny the existence of their bugs, but rather than just playing
blame games, I hope to raise the standard of quality demanded from
FOSS and help newer programmers learn from past mistakes in order not
to repeat them.
