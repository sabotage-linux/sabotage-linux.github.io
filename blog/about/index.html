<div class="article"><h2>Random rants of a linux distro developer</h2>

<div class="pub"></div>
<p>Welcome to DevsOnACID, a blog dedicated to random outbursts about the perils
of open source developments in the age of systemd, rust and cmake.
There's a lot happening the open-source world (just as in the real world) that
goes in a very destructive direction, mostly due to fanboi-ism and hipster
culture.
I hope to raise awareness of these issues from a standpoint of people that want
to compile their entire system from source, and understand the components it
consists of.</p>

<h3>About the author and his distribution</h3>

<p>John Spencer, who goes by <a href="https://github.com/rofl0r">rofl0r</a> online, is the
primary author of <a href="https://sabotage-linux.github.io">sabotage linux</a>, a linux
distribution based on musl libc and busybox, with a focus on hackability,
efficiency and simplicity.</p>

<p>Hackability means that the user compiles all components from source, so he is
empowered to study their code and change/improve the parts that do not work
to his liking. Also it should be made easy to be able to do that, and it should
be able to compile for all sorts of hardware architectures.</p>

<p>An efficient operating system can only be composed of efficient components,
that means components that are both simple in nature and written in a language
and using frameworks that compile to efficient machine code and use only small
amounts of resources. Therefore, the majority of components in sabotage linux
is implemented in the C language, and a very small amount in C++.
No base system components are implemented in resource-hungry scripting
languages.</p>

<p>Bloated components like systemd or hard-to-impossible to bootstrap-from-source
programming languages like rust or java are not really compatible with this
design. Having half a dozen different GUI toolkits installed and loaded into
RAM neither, therefore the default sabotage desktop tries to restrict itself
to components using GTK+2 only.</p>
