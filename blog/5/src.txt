## A Primer for build system developers and users

As the maintainer of
[sabotage linux](https://github.com/sabotage-linux/sabotage),
a distro compiled from source, with >1000
packages, and being involved in the development of
[musl libc](https://musl-libc.org/), I've seen a wide
variety of odd build systems, or regular build systems used in an odd way.
Which resulted in lots of issues trying to get other people's packages building.

The vast majority of build system coders and developers using these build systems
for their packages do not understand in detail how their toolchains are supposed
to be used,
and especially cross-compilation is a topic the majority of people knows nothing
about.
The intent of this blog post is to explain the basic mechanisms, to change this
situation.

But first, let's establish the meaning of some terms.
From here on, the term `user` will be used to mean the person trying to compile
your software package from source. We're not concerned here about people using
the compilation result via a binary package.

Now we will first take a quick look at the basic concepts involved in
compilation, followed by the typical 3 stages of a build process, which are:
Configuration, Compilation, Installation.

## Basic Compilation Concepts

So in order to get your program compiled on a variety of different hosts, you
typically need to interface with the following components:

### The compiler.

For the C programming language, the convention is that on the user's system
there's a C compiler installed in the default search `PATH` with the name `cc`.
It can be overridden with the environment variable `CC`.

so if `CC` is set to `clang`, the build system should use `clang` instead of
`cc`.

A sanely designed build system does something along the lines of:

	if is_not_set($CC): CC = cc

For C++, the default binary name is `c++` and the environment variable `CXX`.

Note that the user may choose to set CC or CXX to something that includes
multiple items, for example `CC=powerpc-gcc -I/tmp/powerpc/include`.

Therefore, in a shell script, when you want to use the CC command to compile
something, the $CC variable needs to be be used unquoted, i.e. `$CC` and not
`"$CC"` since the latter would force the shell to look for a binary with the
spaces inside the filename.

(For the record, the compiler is the program that turns your sourcecode into
 an object file, e.g. `cc foo.c -c -o foo.o`)

### The linker.

Fortunately with C and C++, unless you do highly unusual things, you will
never have to invoke the linker directly. instead you can simply use `CC`
or `CXX` and they will know from the context that a linker is needed, and
call the linker themselves.
(For the record, the linker is what takes a couple
.o files and turns them into an executable or a shared library, e.g.:
`cc foo.o bar.o -o mybinary.elf`)

### Compiler and linker options.

There will be a couple options you will have to use so the compilation works
in a certain way. For example, your code may require the flag `-std=c99` if
you use C99 features.

Additionally, the user will want or need to use certain flags.
For this purpose, the environment variable `CFLAGS` is used.

If the user didn't specify any `CFLAGS` himself, you may decide to set some
sane default optimization flags (the default for GNU autoconf packages is
`-O2 -g -Wall`). The CFLAGS used for the compilation should always put the
user-set CFLAGS last in the command line, so the user has the ability to
override some defaults he doesn't like.
The following logic describes this:

	REQUIRED_CFLAGS=-std=c99
	CFLAGS_FOR_COMPILE=$(REQUIRED_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)

For C++, these flags are called `CXXFLAGS`, and the logic is precisely the
same.

There's also `CPPFLAGS`, which is used for preprocessor directives such as
`-DUSE_THIS_FEATURE -DHAVE_OPENGL` and include directories for header lookup.
More about headers soon. Again, user-supplied `CPPFLAGS` need to be respected
and used after the `CPPFLAGS` the build system requires.

Last but not least we have `LDFLAGS`, these are flags used at link time.
It contains things such as `-L` linker library search path directives,
`-lxxx` directives that specify which libraries to link against, and other
linker options such as `-s` (which means "strip the resulting binary").
Here, again, the rule is
to respect user-provided `LDFLAGS` and put them after your own in the linker
command.

From here on, whenever we talk about `cc` or `CC` or `CFLAGS`, the exact same
applies to `c++`, `CXX` and `CXXFLAGS` for C++.

### Libraries and their headers

When writing code in C or C++, you necessarily need to use libraries installed
on the end users machine. At least, you would need to use the C or C++
standard library implementation. The former is known as `libc`, the latter as
`libstdc++` or `libc++`. Optionally some other libraries, such as `libpng`
may be needed.

In compiled form, these libraries consist of header files, and the library
itself, as either static (`.a archive`) or dynamic library
(`.so, .dynlib, .dll`).
These headers and libs are stored in a location on your user's machine, which
is typically `/usr/include` for headers and `/usr/lib` for libraries, but this
is none of your concern. It's the job of the user to configure his compiler
in such a way that when you e.g. `#include <stdio.h>` it works (usually the user
uses his distro-provided toolchain which is properly set up).

### Cross-compilation

Cross-compilation means that you compile for a different platform than
the one you're using, for example if you want to compile `ARM` binaries for your
raspberry pi from your x86_64 desktop.

It's not really much different than regular compilation, you pass your compiler
name as CC, e.g. `CC=armv7l-linux-musl-gcc` and set your C and CPP flags such
that they point into the lib/ and include/ dirs with your other ARM stuff in it.
For example, if you prepare a rootfs for your raspberry pi in `/tmp/piroot`,
you'd probably set up your compiler-related environment vars as following:

	CC=armv7l-linux-musl-gcc
	CPPFLAGS=-isystem /tmp/piroot/include
	LDFLAGS=-L/tmp/piroot/lib

In compiler jargon, the `armv7l-linux-musl` prefix to your toolchain name is the
so-called `triplet`. All components of your toolchain are prefixed with it, for
example the `ar` archiver is called `armv7l-linux-musl-ar`, the same applies for
`as`, `ld`, `ranlib`, `strip`, `objdump`, etc.

In Autoconf-based build systems, you pass the triplet as
`--host=armv7l-linux-musl` to `./configure`, whereas Makefile-only based systems
usually use a `CROSS_COMPILE` environment variable, which is set to triplet plus
a trailing dash, e.g. `CROSS_COMPILE=armv7l-linux-musl-`.
In your own build system, you should follow the GNU autoconf convention though.

What makes cross-compilation a bit tricky is

- you can't execute binaries that you created with the crosscompiler toolchain
  on your build machine.

  Some packages require to compile tools that are then executed, for example
  to generate some headers and similar things.
  These tools need to be compiled with a different compiler, targeting your
  host's OS, arch, etc, which in autoconf jargon is confusingly called the
  "build" compiler, whereas Makefile-only based build systems call it `HOSTCC`.
  Note that when such programs, to be executed on the host, require other
  additional object files that are needed for the target build too, these
  object files need to be compiled twice, once for the host and once for the
  target. In such a case it is advisable to give the object files different
  extensions, maybe `.ho` for object files meant for the host, and `.o` for
  those intended for the target.

  This also means your configuration process can't use checks that require to
  build and then run a binary.

- There's a variety of reasons host include/ and lib/ directories can leak
  into the build process, causing havoc. In the worst case, you only have an
  include directory leak which has wrong sizes for types in them, which can
  result in a successfully linked binary that will crash or corrupt memory.
  If host library
  directories leak into the build, you will get link errors when the linker
  tries to link ARM and x86_64 binaries together.
  One of the worst offenders in this regard is `libtool`, which should be
  avoided at all costs.


## The Build Process

If you design a build system from scratch, keep in mind that your users probably
don't want to spend a lot of time learning about your system.
They simply want to get the process done as painlessly and quickly as possible
(which implies that the build system itself should have as little external
dependencies as possible).

Please do respect existing conventions, and try to model your build system's
user interface after the well-established [GNU autoconf standards](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Managing-Releases.html#Managing-Releases),
because it's
what's been around for 20+ years and what the majority of packages use, so it's
very likely that the user of your package is familiar with its usage.
Also, unlike more hip build tools of the day, their user interface is the
result of a long evolutionary process. Autoconf does have a lot of ugly sides to
it, but from a user perspective it is pretty decent and has a streamlined way
to configure the build.

### Step1: Configuration

Before we can start building, we need to figure out a few things.
If the package has optional functionality, the user needs to be able to specify
whether he wants it or not. Some functionality might require additional
libraries, etc. This stage in the build process is traditionally done via a
script called `configure`.

#### Enabling optional functionality

Your package may have some non-essential code or feature, that might pull in a
big external library, or may be undesirable for some people for other reasons.

Traditionally, this is achieved by passing a flag such as `--disable-libxy` or
`--without-feature`, or conversely `--with-feature` or `--enable-libxy`.

If such a flag is passed, the script can then write for example a configuration
header that has some preprocessor directive to disable the code at compile time.
Or such a directive is added to the `CPPFLAGS` used during the build.

These flags should be documented when the configure script is being run with
the `--help` switch.

#### System- or Version-specific behaviour

Sometimes one needs to use functionality that differs from system to
system, so we need to figure out in which way the user's system provides it.

The wrong way to go about this is to hardcode assumptions about specific
platforms (OS/compiler/C standard library/library combinations) with ifdefs
like this:

	#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10100000
	/* OpenSSL >= 1.1 added DSA_get0_pqg() */
		DSA_get0_pqg(dsa, &p, &q, &g);
	#else
		...
	#endif

This is wrong for several reasons:

- Linux distros sometimes backport functionality from newer library versions
  to the older library version they ship. Conversely a newer library version
  that supposedly should have the functionality, could have been selectively
  downgraded with a patch fixing a specific bug, which might require to undo
  a new feature.

- For some libraries, as in this case OpenSSL, API-compatible replacements
  exist (here libressl or Apple's fork boringssl).

The proper way to figure out whether `DSA_get0_pqg()` exists, is... to actually
check whether it exists, by compiling a small testcase using it (more below),
and pass a preprocessor flag such as `HAVE_DSA_GET0_PQG` to the code in
question.

Even worse than the above hardcoded version number check is when people assume
that a certain C library implementation, for example `musl`, have a certain bug
or behaviour or lack a certain function, because at the time they tested it
that was the case. If a `__MUSL__` macro [would exist](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/faq.html#Q:-Why-is-there-no-%3Ccode%3E__MUSL__%3C/code%3E-macro?)
, they would just hardcode
their assumption into the code, even though the very next version of musl might
have fixed the bug or added the function in question, which would then result
in compile errors or even worse, bogus behaviour at runtime.

#### Checking for headers

You should NEVER hardcode any absolute paths for headers or libraries into
your build system, nor should you start searching in the user's filesystem for
them. This would make it impossible to use your package on systems with a
non-standard directory layout, or for people that need to crosscompile it
(more on cross-compilation just a little further down).

The majority of third-party libraries install their headers either into a
separate sub-directory in the compiler's default include path
(for example `/usr/include/SDL/*.h`), or if there's only one or two headers
directly into the include dir (for example `/usr/include/png.h`).
Now when you want to test for whether the user's system has the libpng headers
installed, you simply create a temporary .c file with the following contents:

	#include <png.h>
	typedef int foo;

and then use `$CC $CPPFLAGS $CFLAGS -c temp.c` and check whether the command
succeeded. If it did, then the `png.h` is available through either the
compiler's default include directory search paths, or via a user-supplied
`-I incdir` statement which he can provide if his libpng is installed in a
non-standard location such as `$HOME/include`.

Note that this approach is cross-compile safe, because we didn't need to execute
any binary.

If you want to use headers of a library such as `SDL` that installs a number
of headers into a subdir, you should reference them in your code via
`#include <SDL/SDL.h>` and not `#include <SDL.h>`, because the latter will
require the addition of `-I path` include search path directives.

#### Checking for functions in libraries

After you've established that the user has libpng's headers installed, you might
want to check whether it links correctly and whether it provides a certain
function you're using (though testing for this only makes sense if the function
is a recent addition).

Again, you check this by writing a temporary .c file, that looks roughly like:

	#include <png.h>
	int main() {png_set_compression_buffer_size(0, 0);}

the command to test it is: `$CC $CPPFLAGS $CFLAGS temp.c -lpng $LDFLAGS`.

If the command succeeds, it means that one of libpng.a/.so is available in the
compiler's default library search path, (or in some `-L` directive the user
added to his `LDFLAGS`) and that it contains the function
`png_set_compression_buffer_size`.
The latter is established by using a main()
function, which forces the linker to fail on missing symbols (also note the
omission of `-c`).

If your aim is only to test whether the libpng library is installed, the test
can be written as:

	#include <png.h>
	int main() {return 0;}

and compiled exactly as the previous. Note that this test actually checks that
both the header exists AND the library, so by using this kind of test you don't
actually need to test for header and library separately. Again, we merely
compiled the testcase and didn't need to execute it.

#### Pkg-config and derivates

For simple libraries such as `zlib` you should always try first whether you can
simply link to e.g. `-lz`.
If that doesn't work, you can fall back to a tool called `pkg-config` or one of
its clones such as `pkgconf`, which is widely used.
The path to the tool is user provided via the environment variable `PKG_CONFIG`.
If not set, the fall-back is to use `pkg-config` instead.
It can be used like this:

	$PKG_CONFIG --cflags gtk+-2.0

This will print a couple of -I include directives that are required to find the
headers of gtk+2.

Likewise

	$PKG_CONFIG --libs gtk+-2.0

can be used to query the LDFLAGS required for linking gtk+2.
Note that by default, pkg-config looks into `$(prefix)/lib/pkgconfig`, which
is not compatible with crosscompilation.

##### 2 solutions exist to make pkg-config compatible with cross-compilation:

- the environment variable `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR` can be set to the
  crosscompile rootfs root directory, e.g. `/tmp/piroot` and
  `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR` to `/tmp/piroot/lib/pkgconfig`, or

- if `PKG_CONFIG` is not set, but a cross-compile triplet was passed to
  the configuration process, and a triplet-prefixed pkg-config exists in the
  `PATH`, this is being used instead of the host's `pkg-config`, e.g.
  `armv7l-linux-musl-pkg-config`.

##### Now comes the bummer:

The authors of some packages wrote their own package specific pkg-config
replacement, reasoning unknown. For example, on my machine the following
proprietary -config programs exist: `allegro-config`, `croco-config`,
`curl-config`,`freetype-config`, `gpg-error-config`, `icu-config`,
`libpng-config`, `pcap-config`, `pcre-config`, `python-config`,
`sdl-config`, `xml2-config` ...

What they all have in common is that they do things differently and they are not
cross-compile compatible. Usually, whenever one of them is being used
by a build system, cross-compilation breakage follows.
Because these tools simply return the include and library directories of
the host.

Unfortunately, the authors of some of these programs refuse to write portable
pkg-config files instead. OTOH, most of them require no special include dirs,
and their `--libs` invocation simply returns `-lfoo`.
For those few that don't (the worst offenders are apr-1-config tools from
Apache Foundation), as a build system author, I suppose, the only correct way
to deal with them is to not use them at all, but instead force the user to
specify the include and library paths for these libraries with some
configuration parameters.
Example: `--apr-1-cflags=-I/include/apr-1`


#### Checking for sizes of things

In some rare cases, one needs to know e.g. the size of long of the toolchain
target at compile time.
Since we cannot execute any testbinaries that would run e.g.

	printf("%zu\n", sizeof(long));

and then parse their output because we need to stay compatible with
cross-compilers, the proper way to do it is by using a "static assertion"
trick like here:

	/* gives compile error if sizeof(long) is not 8 */
	int arr[sizeof(long) == 8 ? 1 : -1];

Compile the testcase with `$CC $CPPFLAGS $CFLAGS -c temp.c`.

Another way is to run e.g.

	$CC $CPPFLAGS -dM -E - </dev/null | grep __SIZEOF_LONG__

This command (without the piped grep) makes GCC and derivates spit out a list
of built-in macros.
Only GCC and Clang based toolchains that came out during the last couple years
support this though, so the static assert method should be prefered.

#### Checking for endianness

Unfortunately, varying platforms have provided endianness test macros in
different headers.
Because of that, many build system authors resorted to compiling and running
a binary that does some bit tricks to determine the endianness and print a
result.

However since we cannot run a binary as we want to stay cross-compile compatible
, we need to find another way to get the definition.
I've actually spent a lot of effort by trying dozens of compiler versions and
target architectures and came up with a [public domain single-header solution](https://github.com/rofl0r/endianness.h),
that has portable fallback functions that can do endian conversions even if the
detection failed, although at a slight runtime cost.

I would advise its usage, rather than trying to hack together a custom thing.

#### Checking for bugs and similar things

I've also come across a number of checks that required to run a testcase and
therefore prevented crosscompilation from working. Mostly, these are tests
for a certain bug or odd behaviour.
However, it is wrong to assume that because the system the test binary currently
runs on has a certain bug, the end user's system will have the same bug.
The binary might for example be distributed as a package, and might suddenly
start misbehaving if another component that fixes the bug is updated.
Therefore the only safe and correct way to deal with this situation is to write
a check that's
executed when the binary is used at runtime, and then sets a flag like `bug=1;`
and then have two different codepaths, one for a system with the bug and one for
a system without it.

#### Cross-compile specific configuration

In GNU Autoconf, the way to tell it that you're cross-compiling is by setting a
`--host=triplet` parameter with the triplet of the target toolchain, additional
to putting the crosscompiler name into the `CC` environment variable.
The triplet is then used to prefix all parts of the toolchain, like

	RANLIB=$(triplet)-ranlib
	STRIP=$(triplet)-strip

etc.
For the build host, there's also a parameter called `--build=triplet` .
If not set, the configure process will try whether `gcc` or `cc` is available,
and then use that. If set, all toolchain components targeting the host you're on
will be prefixed with this triplet. It can be queried by running
`$CC -dumpmachine`. Usually, it is not necessary to set it.

#### Checking for the target OS

As mentioned it's hugely preferable to test for functionality rather
than platform.
But if you *really* think it's necessary to figure out the target OS,
do not use `uname` which is totally bogus. It simply returns the OS of
the compiler user, who might use an Apple computer but cross-compile for
NetBSD.

You can instead derive the target OS via `$CC -dumpmachine`, which returns the
toolchain target triplet, or by parsing the output of

	$CC $CPPFLAGS -dM -E - </dev/null

#### Configuring paths

Knowledge about system paths is required for 2 reasons. One is that during the
Installation stage we need to know where files like the compiled program binary
need to be installed in. The other is that our program or library might require
some external data files. For example, the program might require a database
at runtime.

For this reason, a `--prefix` variable is passed to the configure step.
On most typical linux installations `--prefix=/usr` would be used for a system
install, whereas `--prefix=/usr/local` is typically used for an alternate
installation from source of a package the distribution provides but for some
reason is not sufficient for the user.
Sabotage Linux and others use an empty prefix, i.e. `--prefix=`, which means
that for example binaries go straight into `/bin` and not `/usr/bin`, etc.
Many hand-written configure scripts get this wrong and treat --prefix= as if
the user hadn't passed --prefix at all, and fall back to the default.
The default, btw is traditionally `/usr/local`.

So in case your program needs a database, let's say `leetpackage.sqlite`, you
would probably hardcode the following db path into your binary:

	#define DB_PATH PREFIX "/share/leetpackage/leetpackage.sqlite"

where PREFIX would be set as part of CPPFLAGS or similar according to the user's
selection.
For more fine-grained control, traditional configure scripts also add options
like `--bindir`, `--libdir`, `--includedir`, `--mandir`, `--sysconfigdir`, etc
additional to `--prefix`,
which, if not set, default to `${prefix}/bin`, `${prefix}/lib`,
`${prefix}/include` etc.

More on paths in the Installation chapter.

### Step 2: The build

After the configuration step finished, it should have written the configuration
data in some form, either a header, or a Makefile include file, which is then
included by the actual Makefile (or equivalent).
This should include any previously mentioned environment variables, so it
is possible to login in a different shell session without any of them set, yet
getting the same result when running `make`.
Some users of GNU autotools create the Makefile from a template (usually called
`Makefile.in`) at the end of the configure run, but I personally found this to
be really impractical, because when making changes to the Makefile template,
configure has to be re-run every single time.
Therefore I recommend writing the settings into a file called
`config.mak`, which is included by the Makefile.

The actual compilation is typically run by executing `make`, which on most
systems defaults to GNU make, which is a lot more powerful than the traditional
BSD makes. Its code is small and written in portable C, so it's easy to get it
bootstrapped quickly on systems that don't have it yet, unlike competitors such
as CMake, which is 1) written in C++ which takes a lot longer to parse than C,
and 2) consists of > 1 million lines of code and 3) occupies a considerable
amount of HDD space once installed.
Anyway, GNU make can even be found pre-installed on the BSDs, it's called
`gmake` there.

Here, the following conventions apply:

- In order to enable a verbose build showing the full compiler command line
  rather than just `CC foo.c` for debugging purposes, a flag `V=1`, short for
  verbose, can be passed as in `make V=1`.
- To use a parallel build, for example to compile one C or C++ file per
  available CPU core, the `-jN` flag is used, such as in `make -j8` if you want
  to use 8 parallel processes.

If a Makefile is used for building, the build process should be tested using
several parallel processes, because failure to document dependencies of files
properly often results in broken parallel builds, even though they seem to work
perfectly with `-j1`.

Do note that you should not `strip` binaries, ever. If the user wants his
binaries stripped, he will pass `-s` as part of his `LDFLAGS`.

### Step 3: Installation

The Installation is typically done using the `make install` command.
Additionally there's an important variable that distro maintainers use for
packaging: `DESTDIR`.

If for example, at configure time, `--prefix=/usr` was set, then
`make install DESTDIR=/tmp/foo` should cause stuff to be installed into
`/tmp/foo/usr`, so if your package compiles a binary called `myprog`, it should
end up in `/tmp/foo/usr/bin/myprog`. A typical install rule would look like
this:

	bindir ?= $(prefix)/bin

	...

	install: myprog
		install -Dm 755 myprog $(DESTDIR)$(bindir)/myprog

here we use the `install` program to install the binary `myprog` to its
destination with mode 755 (`-m 755`) and create all path compontens along
the way (`-D`).
Unfortunately, the `install` program shipped with some BSDs and Mac OS X
refuse to implement these practical options, therefore this
[portable replacement implementation](https://github.com/rofl0r/install.sh) can
be used instead.

It is a good idea and the common practice to explicitly set the permissions
during the install step, because the user doing the installation might
unwittingly have some restrictive umask set, which can lead to odd issues later
on.

Even if the build system you intend to write does not use Makefiles, you should
respect the existing conventions (unlike CMake & co which NIH'd everything)
like `V=1`, `-j8`, `DESTDIR`, `--prefix`, etc.

## Closing thoughts

One of the big advantages of GNU's autotools system is that, from a user's
perspective, they require nothing more than a POSIX-compatible shell to execute
configure scripts, and GNU make, which as already mentioned is really slim,
written in portable C, and widely available while requiring less than one MB
of HDD space (my GNU make 3.82 install takes 750KB total including docs).

So in my opinion, the build system of the future, in whatever language it's
written in, and how many millions of lines of code it consists of, should do
precisely the same: it should at least have the option to generate a configure
script and a *stand-alone* GNU Makefile, which is shipped in release tarballs.
That way only the developers of the package need the build toolkit and its
dependencies installed on their machine, while the user can use the tools he
already has installed, and can interface with the build system in a way he's
already familiar with.
