<div class="article"><h2>Blog moved</h2>

<div class="pub">27 Jan 2025 12:31 UTC</div>
<p>This blog has moved, already since about 4 years, to <a href="https://sabotage-linux.neocities.org/blog/">neocities</a>.
I thought it would suffice to just change the top level links to the blog site,
but i still see the majority of hits from the old URL, so i figure it makes
sense to spell it out explicitly on the old blog itself.</p>

<p>So folks, update your bookmarks to the new URL!</p>

<p><a href="https://sabotage-linux.neocities.org/blog/">https://sabotage-linux.neocities.org/blog/</a>.</p>

<p>The new URL already has 4 more posts i wrote during the past years.
In case you wonder about the why, it has to do with the acquisition of github
by a big corporate entity, and my concerns about how that might affect my
freedom of speech.</p>

<p>See you on the new home!</p>
