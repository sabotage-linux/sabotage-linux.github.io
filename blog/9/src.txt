### Blog moved
## 27 Jan 2025 12:31 UTC

This blog has moved, already since about 4 years, to [neocities](https://sabotage-linux.neocities.org/blog/).
I thought it would suffice to just change the top level links to the blog site,
but i still see the majority of hits from the old URL, so i figure it makes
sense to spell it out explicitly on the old blog itself.

So folks, update your bookmarks to the new URL!

[https://sabotage-linux.neocities.org/blog/](https://sabotage-linux.neocities.org/blog/).

The new URL already has 4 more posts i wrote during the past years.
In case you wonder about the why, it has to do with the acquisition of github
by a big corporate entity, and my concerns about how that might affect my
freedom of speech.

See you on the new home!
